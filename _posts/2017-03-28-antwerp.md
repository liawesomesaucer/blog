Antwerp, a city in Belgium. First heard of the name of this city from playing Civilization V.

![station](/images/post-antwerp/01.jpg)

The Antwerp central station, only a few steps away from the bus. It was built by King Leopold II, and is probably the most beautiful train station I've seen so far.

Down the street behind the station, where trains pass through this elevated portion.

![mall](/images/post-antwerp/04.jpg)

The beginnings of an outdoor shopping center. This architecture is a good break from the heavy use of brick in the Netherlands.

A government building.

A small chocolate shop we stopped by where I bought some chocolate for the fam.

![ramen](/images/post-antwerp/13.jpg)

Ramen, partly because Thomas was craving it (there's none in Utrecht, where he's studying). I'd stick to RakiRaki or Santouka.

Where I slept. The Airbnb we stayed at had around 5 floors, and a cellar.
