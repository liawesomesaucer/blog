Antwerp, a city in Belgium. First heard of the name of this city from playing Civilization V.

The Antwerp Centraal station, only a few steps away from the bus. It was built between 1895 and 1905 and is probably the most beautiful train station I've seen so far.

Down the street behind the station, where trains pass through this elevated portion.

The beginnings of an outdoor shopping center. This architecture is a good break from the heavy use of brick in the Netherlands.

More shots of the shopping center.

![cathedral](/blog/images/post-antwerp/07.jpg)

The largest Gothic church in the Netherlands: the Cathedral of Our Lady, built in the 1300s. 123 meters tall. Originally the right tower was planned to be built similar in design to the left, but was postponed indefinitely after a fire in the 1500s

Another shot of the cathedral from near where we had lunch.

The Steen. This is the oldest building in Antwerp and its old city center. It was partially rebuilt in 1520 by Charles V - note the differing colors of stone used in the reconstruction.

The City Hall.

A small chocolate shop we stopped by where I bought some chocolate for the fam.

![ramen](/blog/images/post-antwerp/13.jpg)

Ramen, partly because Thomas was craving it (there's none in Utrecht, where he's studying). I'd stick to RakiRaki or Santouka.

Where I slept. The Airbnb we stayed at had around 5 floors, and a cellar.

A parting shot of the Antwerp station.
