The largest city in the Netherlands and its capitol by constitution. Interestingly, actual governmenting occurs from The Hague.

First shot of Amsterdam, taken from an Uber, as we were in a rush to see the soon-closing Van Gogh Museum. Unfortunately Lyft doesn't exist in the Netherlands.

Another car window pic. Car was an Audi A8; luxury sedans are great.

A shot of the Van Gogh Museum, including the ticket booth. Though the museum entrance was in the opposite direction of this photo, the actual Van Gogh collection exists in the glass building on the right, accessible through an underground passageway.

Chilled in an arcade for a while, then reached the red light district. Women would stand in the windows under red lights, waiting for clients.

A shot of a canal with more red light district.

I'm more of a green light district kind of guy.
