The city I'm staying at for the majority of the trip. Major thanks to Thomas, who is hosting us.

The Utrecht central station. Got off the train here. Fun fact: the train stations here have public pianos that anyone can play.

Canals are really beautiful part 1.

Canals are really beautiful part 2.  

![domtower](/blog/images/post-utrecht/04.jpg)

The Dom Tower of Utrecht, built in the 1300s. It was once connected to the rest of a cathedral, but in 1674 a large tornado destroyed a center part of it, leaving the tower and rest of the cathedral separate.

A picture of the other side of the cathedral, from the courtyard where the cathedral once stood. Note the use of brick to rebuild and cover damaged parts of the cathedral. The inside was also really beautiful, but photography was not allowed.

Canals are really beautiful part 3.

![fries](/blog/images/post-utrecht/08.jpg)

Some fries I got, with steak stew topping and mayonnaise. Dipping fries in mayo is quite popular here.

![house](/blog/images/post-utrecht/09.jpg)

The Reitveld Schroder house. On the World Heritage List of UNESCO, this house was the only house ever constructed from an architectural movement called De Stijl (Dutch for "The Style").

A building in the University College Utrecht, where we are staying for most of the week.
