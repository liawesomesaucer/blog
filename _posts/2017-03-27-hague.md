A beautiful coastal city, home of the Dutch parliament and beautiful beaches.

At the Hague train station. Here is one aforementioned public piano that anyone can play.

A shot of the Airbnb we're staying at, feat Thomas.

The view from the window. Note the bright colored roofs.

The bathroom is pretty neat as well.

A park we passed through on the way to Indonesian food.

WE INTERRUPT THIS BROADCAST TO BRING YOU THIS PICTURE OF A REAL LIFE SHIBA INU, SEEN IN THE PARK.

Really really good Indonesian food. Definitely has gone up on my list of to-visit countries. Indonesia is home to retired badminton gold medalist Taufik Hidayat, who is known for his strong backhand and trickshots. Maybe this food is the trick to his strength.

The breakfast we had next morning, before heading to the beach. Ham, cheese, bread, chocolate milk, fruit milk and fruit drinks.

Heading to the beach, part 1.

Found a service road leading to the beach.

A shot of the beach and Atlantic.

First time touching the Atlantic.

![trolley](/blog/images/post-hague/10.jpg)

A trolley not unlike the one we took back to our Airbnb. After checking out, we headed downtown in a bus.

![parliament](/blog/images/post-hague/11.jpg)

Parliamentary buildings part 1.

![parliament2](/blog/images/post-hague/12.jpg)

A doorway along the side of the outer building. The roof was especially cool.

![parliament3](/blog/images/post-hague/13.jpg)

A close up of the inner building, or castle?

![parliament4](/blog/images/post-hague/14.jpg)

The outside of the parliament buildings. If you google "The Hague", these are the buildings that will show up.

Another shot, but with glare. The reflections are really beautiful.

![street1](/blog/images/post-hague/street1.jpg)

A random street in the Hague.

![street2](/blog/images/post-hague/street2.jpg)

Gate to Chinatown.

![canal](/blog/images/post-hague/canal.jpg)

Canals are really beautiful.

![dessert](/blog/images/post-hague/dessert.jpg)

A quick snack before leaving. Espresso and mango yogurt cake. Delicious and aesthetic.

Waiting for the train for Delft, where we'd bus to Antwerp.
