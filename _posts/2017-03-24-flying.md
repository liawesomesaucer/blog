Let's get to it: flying can be pretty scary sometimes. But sometimes the views are pretty worth it.

These clouds were beautiful. It was difficult to get a decent picture of them, but picture rolling waves of sand, fluffier but still walkable. It looked eerily calm yet alien.

1.5 hour layover in Keflavik (KEF). Originally built in 1943 for US WWII operations, this airport is now a layover stop for many cross-Atlantic flights.

More clouds after sunrise. Around cruising altitude. Sometimes you could catch glimpses of the ocean through them.

Nearing Amsterdam, a couple minutes after seeing land.

Well-timed picture, after many attempts. Plane is an Airbus 320.

Post-landing. On a train from Amsterdam to Utrecht, where I'm staying.

Cool bridge.

Part of a mall adjacent to the train station at Utrecht. Nice to see familiar brands after many hours in the sky.
